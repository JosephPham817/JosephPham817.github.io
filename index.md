### CPSC 120

* Lab 3
Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorites because as a math major I enjoy calculating using the process 
of finding a single answer. So I liked how the code helped people get to the answer faster espeecally when its about
someone's weight and health. Also while coding it I enjoyed putting in the equations to help find tihs

* Lab 2
Lab 2 was one of my favorites because there was only 1 part to the lab. Also I thought it was because it was 
a madlibs code. Usually madelibs are really funny and my partner and I had fun coding it because 
we I thought we would get it done in like 10-20mmins but there were so many logic error. 

* Lab 1 
Lab 1 was my most favorite labs because it was the beginnning of the semester and honestly It wasn't the lab itself that I found fun, but it was the people I was with. They ended up being good friends that I went to if I needed something the rest of the semester, but also looking back at this lab I saw how easy it was to do but I remember my lab group was struggling on it. So its my favorite because of how simple the looks comepared to the ones  now
